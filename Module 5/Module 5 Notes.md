# Module 5 Notes

#### Service Chaining

Allows you to peer via a virtual appliance to build hub and spoke designs

You can configure user-defined routes that point to virtual machines in peered virtual networks as the next hop IP address, to enable service chaining. Service chaining enables you to direct traffic from one virtual network to a virtual appliance, in a peered virtual network, through user-defined routes.
