# AZ103-Notes


These will be collected notes for the AZ103-Course for future teaches on the topic.

I am making my own notes public for any MCT that wishes to comment / use / or contribute.

Any additions to these note would be greatly appreciated, I will have many more notes to add as I teach the AZ-103.

feel free to contact me on mike@michaelwhitehouse.com if you have any questions or @kramit on twitter.
